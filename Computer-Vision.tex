\chapter{Computer Vision}
Computer Vision is an exciting field that has myriad applications in everyday life. With GPUs becoming more and more accessible to common man, building your own vision applications has never been easier. One of the most popular libraries for developing Computer Vision applications is OpenCV. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the most important techniques that you should know in Computer Vision and how to implement them with OpenCV. Executable code will be provided for all the examples so you can get up and running as soon as possible. Without further ado, let's get started!\\
Note: You could follow the official documentation for many of the examples presented here, but will miss out on a lot of good stuff.
